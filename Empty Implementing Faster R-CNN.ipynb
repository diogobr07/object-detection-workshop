First we'll implement the `generate_anchors_reference` function which will return, given the anchors' settings (i.e. size, aspect ratio, scales), the coordinates for said boxes (in pixel space) assuming they're centered around (0, 0). This will give us, effectively, a $(15, 4)$ array.\n",

Given that we're using a ResNet 101, which has a downsampling factor of 16 (i.e. every point in the final feature map corresponds to a $16\\times16$ region of the original image), we'll select the centers every 16 pixels in each direction.\n",

    "* `base_size`: **side length for a square anchor**, in pixels (e.g. 256). Increasing it makes the reference box cover more area of the image.\n",
    "* `scales`: **scale factors** to consider taking `base_size` as reference. For instance, a scale of `2` will make the effective size `512` if base size was `256`.\n",
    "* `aspect_ratios`: **aspect ratios** of the anchors, expressed as the value of `height / width`. Note that *changing the aspect ratio doesn't change the area the anchor covers*.

    "\n",
    "You might remember when you were implementing the RPN that we used the first three out of four blocks of the ResNet for feature extraction, discarding the final block. The reasoning behind this move was to leverage the fact that the block three should, in principle, detect more *abstract features* than the final, block four. Now we're ready to perform the final classification, so we will first pass our proposals (which are cuts, although resized, of the original feature map) through **the block four of the ResNet**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, once we do this, since we've already extracted all the features we care about, we'll perform **Global Average Pooling** which means, essentialy, to average out the spatial information: we only care that in a given proposal, some feature was present all around. That means we'll be left with a single $1024$-sized vector per proposals.\n",
    "\n",
    "And, finally, pass this fixed-length vector through two fully-connected layers: one for the bounding box resizings and one for the classes. Since we've used the block four of the ResNet already, we'll not be using an intermediate layer."
